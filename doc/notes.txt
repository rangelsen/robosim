TASKS
	- Separate trajectory generation from controller developed by HÃ¥kon
		- s, kappa, etc were introduced to make the movements smoother and
		thus they can be removed without sacrificing fundamental functionality

	- Develop a robust system for multiple camera calibration
		- Can use ICP to obtain a metric of how good the calibration is and
		also perform corrections
		- start with visual inspection as a validation method of the calibration

	- Define obstacles for the robot in a sensible manner
		- voxel grid + sedt3d?
